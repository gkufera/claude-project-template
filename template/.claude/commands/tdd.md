Before writing ANY code, walk me through the TDD cycle:

1. **The Test**: What test are you about to write? What file? What does it test?
2. **Expected Behavior**: What should happen when the code works correctly?
3. **Expected Failure**: What error message do you expect when you run this test before implementation?

Then execute:
1. Write the test
2. Run the test
3. Show me the failure output
4. Write the implementation
5. Run the test
6. Show me the success output
7. Commit with a descriptive message

Do NOT skip any step. I want to see the red-green cycle with actual output.
