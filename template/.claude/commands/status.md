Give me a complete project status:

1. **Git Status**: Run `git status` — any uncommitted changes?
2. **Current Branch**: What branch are we on?
3. **Recent Commits**: Run `git log --oneline -5`
4. **Test Status**: Run Tier 1 tests and report pass/fail
5. **PLAN.md**: What's the current task and step?
6. **Roadmap**: What's the highest priority incomplete item?

Format as a quick dashboard I can scan in 10 seconds.
